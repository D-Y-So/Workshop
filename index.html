                <h2>The Benefits of Semantic HTML</h2>
                <p>
                    Semantic elements endow code with additional meaning. So instead of thoughtlessly writing vague
                    <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s all day, you should take a second to think about what collection of data
                    you're presenting to your audience, and wrap that information in the appropriate tag. It's important
                    to give your methods and variables the proper name. Doing so cuts down on time spent refactoring and
                    debugging down the line.

                <h3>HTML5 Article Tag</h3>
                <p>
                    This HTML tag defines a self-contained, independent piece of content like a blog post, news article,
                    or comment. It is designed for content that can be independently distributed, shared, or reused,
                    providing semantic meaning to the content. A potential source for Article Element is:
                    A magazine/newspaper article, a blog entry, a forum post, a user-submitted a comment.
                    This tag is most often used in two contexts: On a page with a single piece of content, a single
                    <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> element can be used to contain the main content and set it off from the
                    rest of the page.
                    On a page with multiple pieces of content (a blog index page, a search results page, a category
                    page, news feed), multiple <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> elements can be used to contain each
                    individual piece of content.

                <h3>The HTML5 Main Element</h3>
                <p>
                    The <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> HTML element represents the dominant content of the
                    <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> of a document. The main content area consists of content that is
                    directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality of
                    an application. A document mustn't have more than one <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element that doesn't
                    have the hidden attribute specified. The content of a <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element should be
                    unique to the document. Content that is repeated across a set of documents or document sections such
                    as sidebars, navigation links, copyright information, site logos, and search forms shouldn't be
                    included unless the search form is the main function of the page. <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> doesn't
                    contribute to the document's outline; that is, unlike elements such as <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>,
                    headings such as h2.

                <h3>Header and Footer in HTML</h3>
                <p>
                    In the tremendous landscape of web development, understanding the significance of very organized and
                    outwardly engaging web pages is urgent. Headers and footers assume an urgent part in forming the
                    general layout and user experience of a website. In this exhaustive aid, we will dive profound into
                    the universe of HTML headers and footers, investigating their importance, best practices, and how
                    you can use them to make staggering and user-accommodating web pages.
                    In HTML, headers and footers are explicit sections of a web page that contain data ordinarily shown
                    at the top and bottom separately. Headers frequently contain route elements, logos, and initial content, 
                    while footers house copyright data, contact info, and links to significant pages.

                <h3>Div Element for Styling</h3>
                <p>
                    If you need a tag purely for CSS styling or layout purposes, the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>
                    tag is the best choice. The <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag is a generic container that doesn't carry
                    any semantic meaning, making it ideal for grouping elements and applying styles without implying any
                    specific structure or content type. This tutorial will introduce you to styling the HTML Content
                    Division element—or The <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element—using CSS. The The <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>
                    element can be used to structure the layout of a page and break up a webpage into separate components for
                    individual styling. In this tutorial, you will create and style <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements,
                    as well as learn how to add and style other elements inside a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> container.
                    These skills will prepare you to use <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements as layout tools later on.
